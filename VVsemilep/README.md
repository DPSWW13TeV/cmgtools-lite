## analysis steps

1. postprocess nanoAOD samples:
   1. this is done by running `run_vvsemilep_fromNanoAOD_cfg.py` configuration under CMGTools/VVsemilep/cfg area. This script will process the data and or MC samples for a particular specified year where the sample names are specified in files in RootTools/python/samples area. Before running this script make sure the skim settings are proper which are read from CMGTools/VVsemilep/tools/nanoAOD/vvsemilep_modules.py. 
      1. command to run in local (for samll test jobs): `nanopy.py  <outdir>   <config to run>`
      1. running on condor: `nanopy_batch.py  <config to run>  -B -b 'run_condor_simple.sh -t 1440 ./batchScript.sh' -r <outdir> -o <jobsDir> ` 
         (here the <jobsDir> should point to an afs area as condor does not support eos submissions. <outdir> will contain the output root files and could be anywhere. 
   1. once your jobs finish, next thing is to *hadd chunks* (samples are divided into smaller chunks for efficient processing): `haddChunks.py -n <jobsDir>`
      this will add your output root files to <jobsDir> so will neeed to copy/move it to eos before hadding. This step actually runs haddnano script and it takes a while to run.  

1. Once you get the flat nTuples, next step is to **run lepton-jet recleaner friends**. This can be done by choosing the appropriate settings in runFriends.sh script which is placed under CMGTools/VVsemilep/macros. **Object selections used in this steps defined in `tth_modules.py` and any change made in there needs a compilation.** 
   Once you run this step and you need to run a hadd script using: `python ~anmehta/public/haddFriends_v2.py <indir>`. 
   This script will warn you about faulty files (zombies and/or files with missing keys) and missing chunks. Fix the errors (i.e. re-run on affected chunks either in local or on condor) and re-run the script to get your friend trees.

1. After recleaner friends, we run the friends which hold **bdt input variables** needed to train BDTs. Follow the previous step with appropriate options to run this step. 
1. At this point we run **BDT reader** to compute bdt score for data and MC samples again using `runFriends.sh` with appropriate option. 
   We use different trainings for 2016 and 2017 and this step you would need to choose the year for that too. 
1. Now we are all set to run 2lss/3l skimming, this helps to speed up the plot/card making steps as we reduce the sample size significantly. this step is run in local. 
  1. commands to run skimming are here: `VVsemilep/python/plotter/runSkimming.sh`. You must specify a skim selection, a year to run on, and also the samples you want to run which are specified  in a  mca file. This will skim the parent trees and recleaner friends also.
  1. command to run skimming only on the friend trees (like for the friends with bdt variables) is also there in the same script.
 
1. Post-skimming, it's time to use `runFriends_v2.sh` again with post-skimming friend options. you will need to run it atleast twice. In the first step you can run friends with tauCount, lepSFs and jme vars (options) in parallel and then second time you run on recl_allvars step. 

1. Once you get all the ingredients in place, execute `VVsemilep/python/plotter/plots_VVsemilep.py` with options depending on what you are trying to do.
